# Website Simulation for 3 DOF Articulated RRR Manipulator

![3D Model and Control Interface for the 3 DOF Manipulator](./pimg.png)

This image provides a preview of our 3 DOF articulated RRR manipulator website. The interface is designed for intuitive interaction and real-time updates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Simulation Demonstration in Website
Below is an image preview of the simulation:
